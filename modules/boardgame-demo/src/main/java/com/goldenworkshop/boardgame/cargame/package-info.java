 * This package contains a demo game used to demonstrate how to use the framework. The game is a simple car racing game.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Each player rolls 1 six-sided dice every turn  and moves their car an equal number of tiles forward, until one player has a combined score of 50 or above.
 * The other player(s) then has a single, last turn to beat the score of the first player.
 * <p>
 *  <p>
 *  The game then ends and the player with the highest score wins, the first player to reach 50+ winning any ties.
